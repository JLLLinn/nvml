/*
 * file_windows.c -- Windows emulation of Linux-specific system calls
 */

/*
 * XXX - The initial approach to NVML for Windows port was to minimize the
 * amount of changes required in the core part of the library, and to avoid
 * preprocessor conditionals, if possible.  For that reason, some of the
 * Linux system calls that have no equivalents on Windows have been emulated
 * using Windows API.
 * Note that it was not a goal to fully emulate POSIX-compliant behavior
 * of mentioned functions.  They are used only internally, so current
 * implementation is just good enough to satisfy NVML needs and to make it
 * work on Windows.
 *
 * This is a subject for change in the future.  Likely, all these functions
 * will be replaced with "util_xxx" wrappers with OS-specific implementation
 * for Linux and Windows.
